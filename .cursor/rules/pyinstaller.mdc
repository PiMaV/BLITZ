# PyInstaller Compatibility (PRIO 1)

All code added or changed in this repository MUST work when the app is packaged with PyInstaller.

- Icons, Qt resources (`:/icon/...`): Must resolve in packaged build
- File paths: Prefer `Path(__file__).resolve().parent` or PyInstaller-safe patterns
- Imports: Ensure resources are registered before dialogs/widgets use them
- No assumptions about CWD; use `sys._MEIPASS` when needed for bundled data

When in doubt: test the packaged executable, not just `python -m blitz`.
