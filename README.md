# BLITZ

## TL;DR
**BLITZ** is a high-performance, matrix-based image viewer built for efficiently managing massive datasets but equally suitable for single-image analysis. For example, it can load 21,000 images (~25GB) in just 35 seconds on a standard gaming laptop.

## Download
[Download the latest release for Windows](https://github.com/CodeSchmiedeHGW/BLITZ/releases/latest)  
No installation neededâ€”just a single, standalone *.exe file.

## Overview
**BLITZ** (Bulk Loading and Interactive Time series Zonal analysis) is an open-source image viewer developed at [INP Greifswald](https://www.inp-greifswald.de). It specializes in the rapid loading, visualization, and analysis of large image datasets, while also being an excellent tool for detailed single-image inspection.

**Key Features:**
- **Fast Data Handling:** Handles very large datasets efficiently (i.e. 21,000 images (~25GB) in just 35 seconds on a standard gaming laptop).
- **Easy Data Handling:** Drag-and-drop functionality for various image and video formats, including NUMPY matrices (*.npy).
- **Easy-to-use:** Automatic resource management for large and small datasets.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive GUI with mouse-based navigation and shortcut capabilities.
- **Advanced Image Processing:** Matrix-based processing, with fast statistical calculations (i.e. Mean image of the 21k dataset: 1.7 seconds).
- **Built on Python**, with Qt and PyQtGraph for high performance and flexibility

## Development

To compile and develop locally:

1. Clone the repository:

        $ git clone https://github.com/CodeSchmiedeHGW/BLITZ.git
        $ cd BLITZ

2. Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies:

        $ pip install poetry
        $ poetry install
        $ poetry run python -m blitz

    Sometimes the installation with poetry might fail due to package restrictions with ``PyQt5``.
    For a quick fix, comment out the following three lines in [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml).
    ```
    # PyQt5 = "^5.15.11"
    # pyqtgraph = "^0.13.7"
    # QDarkStyle = "^3.2.3"
    ```
    Afterwards, just install these packages via ``pip`` inside the newly created virtual
    environment:

        $ poetry shell
        $ python -m pip install PyQt5==5.15.11
        $ python -m pip install pyqtgraph==0.13.7
        $ python -m pip install QDarkStyle==3.2.3

3. To create a binary executable:

        $ pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole --icon=./resources/icon/blitz.ico blitz_main.py
