## High Priority Features

## Medium Priority

*   **Dual-Build Setup:** Ability to build Standard and Full EXE (= Exotic Data flavours).
*   **Proper Exporter:** Dialog with Options to export as *.npy or image for Raw / Pipeline / PCA data
*   **RoSEE:** Check Isolines and normalization (Autozoom should activate).
*   **Mouse Wheel Zoom:** Allow zooming only on one axis (in extraction plots?).

## Low Priority / Long Term / Discussion
