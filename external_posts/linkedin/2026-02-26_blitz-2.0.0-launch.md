BLITZ v2.0 is out!



Most folder-based image workflows still treat images as files.  

BLITZ treats them as structured data.



BLITZ is a high-performance, matrix-based image viewer for working with large scientific image datasets stored in folder structures — without requiring database backends.



If you regularly inspect large stacks of semantically connected images on disk (research, medical imaging, industrial inspection), this approach is often significantly faster and more flexible than classic tools.



Internally, images are treated as a 3D matrix, enabling efficient matrix-based processing and rapid exploration of large datasets.



What’s new in v2.0:



• Fully refactored core  

• Loading via user-friendly dialogs  

• More direct timeline navigation and image aggregation  

• Improved memory handling  

• Better support for large image stacks  

• Drag-and-drop PCA  



Real-world benchmark:

Loading, scaling, and converting ~21,000 RGB images (~2.5 GB raw data) into ~6.2 GB of grayscale matrix data in ~30 s on a laptop.



BLITZ has existed for more than two years and was already technically strong early on, but never received much visibility. This release focuses on making the tool — and the underlying engineering approach — more accessible again.



If you work with large folder-based image datasets and want a lightweight, high-performance workflow, feel free to take a look.



BLITZ focuses on matrix-based exploration. 

A companion project, WOLKE, handles structured crawling and metadata preparation for large folder-based datasets. A refactored release will follow.
